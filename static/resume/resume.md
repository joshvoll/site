## Portfolio Highlights

### [Olin](https://github.com/Xe/olin)

A work-in-progress event sourcing platform built with WebAssembly. This would allow you to load data in on one end and then let the machine take care of it without having to care about it. Worker functions would be compiled to WebAssembly to make the resulting code independent of any individual CPU, allowing for an easier migration to another CPU architecture (such as aarch64 or ppc64be) without having to recompile existing code.

I have written multiple blogposts on this project:

- https://christine.website/blog/olin-1-why-09-1-2018
- https://christine.website/blog/olin-2-the-future-09-5-2018

As of March 21, 2019, Olin is able to run binaries compiled with [Go 1.12.x WebAssembly support](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/WebAssembly). 

### [ilo Kesi](https://github.com/Xe/x/tree/master/discord/ilo-kesi)

A chatbot that parses its commands through the grammar of the constructed language [Toki Pona](http://tokipona.org), then figures out what the user is asking for using a lookup table and executes that request.

### [When Then Zen](https://github.com/Xe/when-then-zen)

This is meditation instructions translated into Gherkin, a-la:

```
Feature: Anapana (mindfulness via breathing) meditation
  Background:
    Given no assumption about meditation background
    And a willingness to learn
    And no significant problems with breathing through the body's nose
    And I am seated or laying down comfortably
    And no music is playing

  Scenario Outline: mindfulness of breathing
    As a meditator
    In order to be mindful of the body's breath
    When I <verb> through the body's nose
    Then I focus on the sensations of breath
    Then I focus on the feelings of breath through the nasal cavity
    Then I focus on the feelings of breath interacting with the nostrils
    Then I repeat until done

    Examples:
      | verb   |
      | inhale |
      | exhale |
```

This has been well-recieved by coworkers, friends and others. I have written more on the subject [here](https://christine.website/blog/when-then-zen-anapana-2018-08-15).
